# Claude Phone üì±

**A secure, browser-based terminal for remote development‚Äîcontrol your entire development environment from any device.**

Claude Phone is a self-hosted web application that provides real-time terminal access to your development environment through any web browser. Whether you're using Claude Code CLI, running tests, or managing your git repositories, Claude Phone turns any device into a powerful development workstation.

## The Problem

Modern developers need access to their development environment from anywhere. Whether you're debugging on your phone during a commute, running tests from a tablet, or executing AI-assisted refactoring from a friend's computer, you need secure, real-time access to your tools.

## The Solution

Claude Phone provides two powerful interfaces:

### üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Terminal (Primary Interface)
A full-featured browser-based terminal powered by WebSockets and xterm.js:
- **Real Bash Shell:** Complete terminal access with PTY emulation
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Type commands and see results instantly
- **Mobile Optimized:** Works beautifully on phones and tablets
- **Secure Access:** HTTP Basic Auth protects your terminal

### üöÄ REST API (Advanced Usage)
Programmatic access for automation and integrations:
- **Natural Language Commands:** Send prompts to Claude Code CLI
- **Streaming Responses:** Get real-time command output
- **Bearer Token Auth:** Secure API access for scripts

## Key Features

- **üîê Security First:** Multiple authentication methods, isolated processes
- **‚ö° Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket-based terminal, streaming API responses
- **üì± Mobile Friendly:** Responsive design works on any device
- **üê≥ Easy Deployment:** Docker container ready for cloud platforms
- **üõ†Ô∏è Extensible:** Clean architecture for customization

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-phone.git
cd claude-phone

# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set your credentials

# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t claude-phone .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env claude-phone
```

Access the terminal at `http://localhost:8000` (login with your configured credentials).

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file

# Run the server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Terminal Access (HTTP Basic Auth)
CP_USER=your_username
CP_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# API Access (Bearer Token)
CLAUDE_PHONE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

## Usage

### Terminal Interface

1. Open your browser to `http://your-server:8000`
2. Log in with your configured username and password
3. You now have a full terminal in your browser!

```bash
# Run any command
ls -la

# Use Claude Code CLI
claude --prompt "refactor the utils.py file to improve readability"

# Run tests
pytest

# Git operations
git status
git commit -m "Fixed bug in authentication"
```

### REST API

For programmatic access, use the API endpoints:

```bash
# Execute a command
curl -X POST http://your-server:8000/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "analyze the security of auth.py",
    "repo_path": "/app/myproject",
    "args": "--yes"
  }'

# Check server status
curl http://your-server:8000/status

# Get logs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here" \
  http://your-server:8000/logs
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/)

### Deploy to Render

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new Web Service on Render
3. Connect your forked repo
4. Set environment variables (CP_USER, CP_PASSWORD, CLAUDE_PHONE_API_TOKEN)
5. Deploy!

## Architecture

Claude Phone uses a modular architecture:

- **FastAPI Backend:** High-performance async Python server
- **WebSocket + PTY:** Real-time terminal emulation
- **xterm.js Frontend:** Professional terminal rendering
- **Docker:** Consistent deployment across platforms

## Security Considerations

- Always use strong passwords for CP_USER and CP_PASSWORD
- Keep your CLAUDE_PHONE_API_TOKEN secret
- Use HTTPS in production (reverse proxy recommended)
- Run in a container or VM for process isolation
- Regularly update dependencies

## Project Status
